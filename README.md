# plantbrain-Signalize

`plantbrain-Signalize` is a signal processing and anomaly detection package designed for time series data. The package provides various techniques for anomaly detection, including **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, **Kalman Filter**, and **Wavelet Transform**. These methods are highly effective in identifying irregular patterns and detecting anomalies in time series signals across different domains such as industrial systems, healthcare, and finance.

## Features

- **Signal Processing Techniques**: Implementations of FFT, Kalman Filter, and Wavelet Transform for time series data.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect anomalies in signals using different methods.
- **Preprocessing**: Signal normalization, noise removal, and resampling techniques to prepare data for analysis.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new signal processing techniques and anomaly detection models.

## Installation

### Install with pip

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install plantbrain-Signalize
